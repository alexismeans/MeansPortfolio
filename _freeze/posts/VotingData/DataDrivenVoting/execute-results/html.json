Similar to many of the other graphs, this could not be comparable because of the amount of time played or games play by each player.

Players with lower scores mean that they're defensive efforts are contributing significantly to the teams success. From this graph I decided to filter my final results to the individuals with less than 75 GA and 600 SA.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(top.defense, aes(x = SA, y = GA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Against vs Shots Against \",\n       x = \"Shots Against (SA)\",\n       y = \"Goals Against (GA)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](DataDrivenVoting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLastly, I decided to look at the count of scores against the team from my filtered dataset. These individuals have spent the most time on the ice during the games, had the least amount of goals against and shots against their team, as well as the lowest chance of scores against their team while they were on the ice.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwin.defense <- top.defense %>% \n    filter(GA <= 75 ) %>% \n    filter(SA <= 600 ) %>% \n  arrange(desc(SCA)) %>% \n  top_n(30, SCA)\n\nggplot(win.defense, aes(x = reorder(Player, SCA), y = SCA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Scoring Chances Against for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"SCA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](DataDrivenVoting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBecause of these results this would be my ballet:\n\n-   Drew Doughty\n\n-   Tony DeAngelo\n\n-   Filip Hronek\n\n-   Quinn Hughes\n\n-   Noah Dobson\n\n# Calder Memorial Trophy\n\n**What is it:** Given to the player “adjudged to be the most proficient in his first year of competition.” This is essentially the rookie of the year award.\n\nFor this trophy I filtered it similarly to Hart Memorial Trophy. I filtered the dataset to only include the top 50 players that had the most time played per game. I then compared this time to their overall Corsi percentage. I chose to filter the dataset again to only include the players that had spent more than 19 minutes on the ice per game because that time frame seemed to be when the Corsi statistics start to fall due to players spending more time on the ice.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nOnIce.rookie <- OnIce.Skater.Rookie %>%\n  mutate(TOI_per_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop.rookie <- OnIce.rookie %>%\n  arrange(desc(TOI_per_GP)) %>%\n  top_n(50, TOI_per_GP)\n\nggplot(top.rookie, aes(x = TOI_per_GP, y = CF.)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Corsi vs. Time played per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 30, by = 1)) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](DataDrivenVoting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI then created a bargraph to view the players with the highest Corsi percentage from this group.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop.rookie.cf <- top.rookie %>%\n  filter(TOI_per_GP <= 19 ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %>%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top.rookie.cf, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](DataDrivenVoting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBased on these results my ballot would be:\n\n-   Alex Laferriere\n\n-   Brandt Clarke\n\n-   Pavel Dorofeyev\n\n-   Jordan Spence\n\n-   Matt Coronato\n\n# Frank J.
