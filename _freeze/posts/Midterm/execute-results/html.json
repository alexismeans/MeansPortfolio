This dynamic environment supports a unique population of bighorn sheep — one that, remarkably, has avoided the disease outbreaks that often devastate other herds.\n\nMy research focuses on understanding the nutritional requirements of these bighorn sheep and how those needs shift throughout their reproductive cycle due to changing metabolic demands. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that links their nutritional requirements to movement patterns. By doing so, we can identify potential threats, such as areas where bighorn sheep may come into contact with domestic livestock, and pinpoint critical habitats essential for their survival.\n\nTo achieve this, I am collecting vegetation data to calculate a measure of “**suitable biomass**”—essentially, the portion of available forage that meaningfully contributes to the sheep’s energy needs at different reproductive stages. This metric is created using measures of digestible energy and digestible protein. I have currently not finalized my values of \"suitable biomass\" but I could look at the preliminary values of digestible energy and digestible protein. Eventually using this metric, I will develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to map areas of high and low nutritional quality across the landscape.\n\nThese techniques will can help determine which resources most influence bighorn sheep movement and allow us to predict future movement patterns—a critical step in ensuring their continued success in this landscape. By bridging nutritional ecology with movement ecology, this research will contribute valuable insights into how bighorn sheep navigate their environment and help inform conservation strategies for this unique, disease-free population.\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lpSolve)\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nlibrary(tools)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Define the path to the directory containing the file\nexcelpath <- \"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/FRESH/processed.data/\"\n\n# Define the specific file name\nfilename <- \"FRESH.test.data.xlsx\"\n\n# Construct the full file path\nexcel.file <- file.path(excelpath, filename)\n\n# Load the workbook and read the data\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nhabitat <- loadWorkbook(excel.file)\ndata <- data.frame(readWorkbook(excel.file, sheet = \"FRESH Data\", startRow = 1, colNames = TRUE))\n\n\nplant <-read.csv(\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/Cleaning/processed.data/plant.csv\")\n\ndata <- data %>% \n  rename(Code = Plant.Code) %>% \n  left_join(y = plant, \n            by = \"Code\",\n            relationship = \"many-to-one\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Quality Trends\n\nWith some of my quality data, I wanted to start by comparing the measurements of digestible energy (DE) and digestible protien (DP) between plant species and phenological stages that I observed while I was sampling.

To start I wanted to looks at the density of biomass for all native vs invasive species within the transects that I sampled in our study area.
