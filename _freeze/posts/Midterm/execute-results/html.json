This dynamic environment supports a unique population of bighorn sheep — one that, remarkably, has avoided the disease outbreaks that often devastate other herds.\n\nMy research focuses on understanding the nutritional requirements of these bighorn sheep and how those needs shift throughout their reproductive cycle due to changing metabolic demands. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that links their nutritional requirements to movement patterns. By doing so, we can identify potential threats, such as areas where bighorn sheep may come into contact with domestic livestock, and pinpoint critical habitats essential for their survival.\n\nTo achieve this, I am collecting vegetation data to calculate a measure of “**suitable biomass**”—essentially, the portion of available forage that meaningfully contributes to the sheep’s energy needs at different reproductive stages. This metric is created using measures of digestible energy and digestible protein. I have currently not finalized my values of \"suitable biomass\", but I do have preliminary values of digestible energy and digestible protein. Eventually using this metric, I will develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to map areas of high and low nutritional quality across the landscape.\n\nThese techniques will can help determine which resources most influence bighorn sheep movement and allow us to predict future movement patterns—a critical step in ensuring their continued success in this landscape. By bridging nutritional ecology with movement ecology, this research will contribute valuable insights into how bighorn sheep navigate their environment and help inform conservation strategies for this unique, disease-free population.\n\n### Data Wrangling\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lpSolve)\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nlibrary(tools)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Define the path to the directory containing the file\nexcelpath <- \"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/FRESH/processed.data/\"\n\n# Define the specific file name\nfilename <- \"FRESH.Subset.xlsx\"\n\n# Construct the full file path\nexcel.file <- file.path(excelpath, filename)\n\n# Load the workbook and read the data\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nhabitat <- loadWorkbook(excel.file)\ndata <- data.frame(readWorkbook(excel.file, sheet = \"FRESH Data\", startRow = 1, colNames = TRUE))\n\n\nplant <-read.csv(\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/Cleaning/processed.data/plant.csv\")\n\ndata <- data %>% \n  rename(Code = Plant.Code) %>% \n  left_join(y = plant, \n            by = \"Code\",\n            relationship = \"many-to-one\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exploring Quality Trends\n\n### Comparing DE and DP values for phenological stage\n\nUsing a subset of my quality data, I began by comparing measurements of digestible energy (DE) and digestible protein (DP) across plant species and phenological stages. My main goal was to explore whether there is a correlation between high DE and high DP. The scatter plot results showed a pattern consistent with my expectations: the highest values for both DE and DP occur during the newly emergent (N) and budding (B) stages. These values drop sharply by the flowering (FL) stage and remain relatively stable thereafter.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndata$Phenology <- factor(data$Phenology, levels = c(\"N\", \"B\", \"FL\", \"FR\", \"M\", \"C\"))\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = DP, y = DE)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"red\") + \n  labs(title = \"Relationship Between DE and DP by Phenology\",\n       x = \"Digestible Protein (DP)\",\n       y = \"Digestible Energy (DE)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phenology, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.05, 0)) +  \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.05, 0)) +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTo better visualize the trends in DP and DE across phenological stages, I isolated the DE and DP values for direct comparison. Both metrics follow the expected pattern, showing a general decline over time. While many species meet the DE requirement of 11.5 kJ per gram of forage, very few meet the necessary DP threshold of 7.5 g per 100 g of forage beyond the newly emergent stage. These thresholds represent the minimum forage quality needed to meet the energetic and protein demands of a lactating female sheep.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Ensure Phenology is a factor with the correct order\ndata$Phenology <- factor(data$Phenology, levels = c(\"N\", \"B\", \"FL\", \"FR\", \"M\", \"C\"))\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = Phenology, y = DE, fill = Phenology)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +  \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Digestible Energy (DE) by Phenology\",\n       x = \"Phenology\",\n       y = \"DE(kJ g^-1)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 11.5, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6.4, y = 11.8, label = \"11.5\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"italic\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x = Phenology, y = DP, fill = Phenology)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +  \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Digestible Protien (DP) by Phenology\",\n       x = \"Phenology\",\n       y = \"DP (g protien/100g forage)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 7.5, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6.5, y = 8, label = \"7.5\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"italic\")+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 12))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Quality Metrics Compared across Vegetation Type\n\nI was curious whether this trend varied across different vegetation types, particularly in riparian areas, which retain the most moisture.

This analysis produced my estimate of \"suitable biomass.\"\n\nWhile my initial hypothesis was that riparian areas would stand out for their nutrient quality, this was not supported by the DE and DP values alone. However, due to the higher plant density in these moisture-rich areas, riparian zones did yield a much greater total biomass, resulting in higher suitable biomass values overall compared to other vegetation types.\n\nOne vegetation type that stands out is scabland. Found mostly on exposed ridges, these areas are typically rocky, wind-swept, and sun-exposed—conditions not usually associated with high productivity. However, these ridges are often the most accessible points in the landscape and are frequently used by landowners for grazing cattle on BLM land. They also lie closer to potential sources of agricultural runoff and experience more frequent disturbance. I suspect that these human influences may be altering the natural composition and productivity of the scabland community. Therefore, I plan to include distance to private land as a variable in my GAM, as I believe it may be a key factor shaping this vegetation type.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = PVT, y = SuitableBiomass, fill = PVT)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Suitable Biomass Across PVTs\",\n       x = \"Plant Vegetation Type (PVT)\",\n       y = \"Suitable Biomass\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 170))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Quality Trends overtime\n\nNext, I looked at how these forage quality metrics changed over time. It’s important to note that if a transect did not meet the nutritional requirements for a lactating female sheep, it was assigned a suitable biomass value of zero. Because of this, it may appear that my sampling ended in early July, even though I continued collecting data through August. This is likely because many transects no longer met the nutritional thresholds by mid-summer, resulting in more zeros for suitable biomass.\n\nThe trends in suitable biomass and digestible energy align with my expectations—they both decline over time. Digestible protein, however, remains relatively stable throughout the season.\n\nIt’s also validating to see that my assumption about the timing of the “green-up”—the period when forage is at its most nutritious—was accurate. The first graph shows a steady decline in suitable biomass until mid-May, after which values remain fairly constant with only a slight decrease through the rest of the summer.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define the Julian days and corresponding month labels\ndate_breaks <- c(92, 122, 155, 185)\ndate_labels <- c(\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\")\n\n\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = SuitableBiomass)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Suitable Biomass Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"Suitable Biomass\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = AveDE)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average DE Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"DE\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = AveDP)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average DP Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"DP\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Midterm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Biomass Trends\n\nOne of the key parts of my project is understanding the spread of invasive species throughout the canyon, specifically cheat grass.

This will allow me to project these values of suitable biomass to other 30x30m pixels with similar covariates and predict how vegetative quality changes throughout the canyon in different times of the year.\n",
