This dynamic environment supports a unique population of bighorn sheep (BHS)—one that, remarkably, has avoided the disease outbreaks that often devastate other herds.\n\nMy research focuses on understanding the nutritional requirements of these bighorn sheep and how those needs shift throughout their reproductive cycle due to changing metabolic demands. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that links their nutritional requirements to movement patterns. By doing so, we can identify potential threats, such as areas where bighorn sheep may come into contact with domestic livestock, and pinpoint critical habitats essential for their survival.\n\nTo achieve this, I am collecting vegetation data to calculate a measure of “**suitable biomass**”—essentially, the portion of available forage that meaningfully contributes to the sheep’s energy needs at different reproductive stages. Using this metric, I will develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to map areas of high and low nutritional quality across the landscape.\n\nIn the final phase of my project, this GAM will be incorporated into resource selection functions (RSFs)or integrated step selection analyses (iSSFs). These techniques will help determine which resources most influence bighorn sheep movement and allow us to predict future movement patterns—a critical step in ensuring their continued success in this landscape. By bridging nutritional ecology with movement ecology, this research will contribute valuable insights into how bighorn sheep navigate their environment and help inform conservation strategies for this unique, disease-free population.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lpSolve)\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nlibrary(tools)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#* Set your path to FRESH Data *#\n#* \nexcelpath=\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/FRESH/processed.data/\" \n\n#* Define the file in the above path to locate *#\n#* \nhabs = list.files(path=excelpath, pattern=\".xlsx\", all.files=F, full.names=F, recursive=FALSE, ignore.case=T,include.dirs=FALSE) \n\n#* Define the file path *#\n#* \nexcel.file = paste0(c(excelpath,habs),collapse=\"\")\n\n#* Load it *#\n#* \nhabitat=loadWorkbook(excel.file)\ndata = data.frame(openxlsx::readWorkbook(excel.file, sheet=\"FRESH Data\", startRow=1, colNames=TRUE))\n```\n:::\n",
