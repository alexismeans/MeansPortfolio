## Welcome

I’m Alexis Means, a master’s student collaborating with the University of Idaho and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. My research focuses on bighorn sheep, examining how their nutritional choices influence population dynamics, survival, and growth. I’m analyzing both forage availability and quality across different habitats in the John Day Canyon to understand how seasonal and spatial variation in nutrition affects sheep foraging behavior and overall health.
