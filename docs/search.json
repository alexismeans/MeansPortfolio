    "text": "My name is Alexis Means! I’m a research assistant working with the University of Idaho and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to study one of Oregon’s most successful bighorn sheep populations. My research focuses on how these sheep navigate their environment and make tough decisions about what to eat when faced with difficult tradeoffs.\nEarly on, I’ll be analyzing vegetation data to see how different plant species and growth stages change across multiple vegetation communities and seasons. In the long run, I’ll use this information to build a model that maps the nutritional landscape, helping us better understand bighorn sheep movement."

    "text": "Describing my Data\nThese datasets come together to create a multidimensional table with all kinds of information about the species observed in my transects. Each table focuses on a unique combination of species ID and phenology stage, which is what I’m using as the main unit of observation. To describe each of these unique combinations, I’ve included several attributes. The quantitative ones include things like biomass weight, percent aerial cover, and nutritional quality. There are also some categorical attributes, like the vegetation community where the species was found and the season it was observed.

I’ve also included a table that lists and explains all the attributes—some are repeated across datasets, so I’ve only described them once.

Because some of the names are so obnoxiously long, I decided it was more effective to color each box and use a key to identify the different communities. I was surprised to see that the scabland shrubland community had the greatest biodiversity. A lot of our sampling was done within the grassland community because it makes up a majority of our study area, so I expected that or the riparian area to have the greatest diversity. The more you know I guess.\n\n\nPVT Species Composition\nIf I wanted to approach this slightly different and make it really overwhelming, I could look at the composition of species observed in each community instead of the richness and show each species in a stacked bar graph.\n\n\nCode\ncomp1 &lt;- comp1 %&gt;% mutate(PVT = as.factor(PVT))\n\ntop_30 &lt;- comp1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(PVT, ActualName.x) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  arrange(PVT, desc(Count)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PVT) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 30)\n\ntop_10_names &lt;- top_30 %&gt;%\n  count(ActualName.x, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10) %&gt;%\n  pull(ActualName.x)\n\nggplot(top_30 %&gt;% filter(ActualName.x %in% top_10_names), \n       aes(x = PVT, y = Count, fill = ActualName.x)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Species composition within Vegetation Communities\",\n       x = \"Vegetation Type\", y = \"Spp Count\", fill = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.key.size = unit(5, \"pt\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is a mess of squished colors and scientific names that most people don’t know or care about when making this comparison. It also does not get the same point across that I do when comparing species richness. Since I sampled the grassland community so much, comparing its diversity to the other vegetation communities is inconsistent and does not demonstrate the diversity of that community. Believe it or not I also had to limit the number of names to the top 30 within the legend to make the graph even remotely readable."

There is so much information and overlap between the different lines that it is hard to tell what is happening with any of them because they are stacked on top of each other. The color scale also does not work for this because of the gradient, the colors are too closely related and are even harder to differentiate when they are all jumbled together."

I started by looking at the Corsi % for each of the players.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ntop_players &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top_players, aes(x = reorder(Player,-CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it arguable that individuals with less time on the ice or do not play as many games are not contributing as much to their teams success. I decided to show a scatterplot of the Corsi percentage compared to the players time spent on the ice during the game. This showed that some of the individuals with the highest Corsi score did not spend as much time on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nOnIce.Skater &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;%\n  mutate(TOI_per_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop_players &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(20, CF.)\n  \nggplot(top_players, aes(x = TOI_per_GP, y = CF.)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) vs. Time played per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 2)) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this I chose to filter the dataset one more time to only include individuals who spent more than 16 minutes on the ice per game and then created a bar graph to view individuals with the highest corsi percentage within this group.\n\n\nCode\ntop.indv &lt;- top_players %&gt;%\n  filter(TOI_per_GP &lt;= 16 ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top.indv, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing these results my top 5 picks would be:\n\nNathan Clurman\nSamuel Bolduc\nJustin Sourdif\nEmil Bemstrom\nRasmus Asplund\n\n\n\nVezina Trophy\nWhat is it: Presented to the goaltender “adjudged to be the best at this position.” NHL general managers vote on this award.\nI wanted to start of by looking at the statistics fo the GSAA (goals saved above average). To me this seemed like the most valuable statistic to determine which goaltender is the best at what they do. I compared the GSAA to each players time spent on the ice per games played again.\n\n\nCode\nGoalie &lt;- Goalie %&gt;% \n   mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop_goalie &lt;- Goalie %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(GSAA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, GSAA)\n\nggplot(top_goalie, aes(x = TOI_by_GP, y = GSAA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Saved Above Average vs. Time player per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"GSAA\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(40, 65, by = 5)) +  # Custom x-axis intervals from 15 to 30 in steps of 5\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince most of the players averaged above 50 TOI/GP, I decided to remove anyone who spent less than 50 TOI/GP because they will most likely have skewed numbers. I then decided to compare the GSAA to the high danger GSAA.\n\n\nCode\nGoalie_filtered&lt;- Goalie %&gt;%\n  filter(TOI_by_GP &gt;= 50)\n\ntop_goalie &lt;- Goalie_filtered %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(GSAA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, GSAA)\n\nggplot(top_goalie, aes(x = HDGSAA, y = GSAA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Saved Above Average vs. High Danger Goals Saved Above Average \",\n       x = \"HDGSAA\",\n       y = \"GSAA\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 65, by = 10)) +  # Custom x-axis intervals from 15 to 30 in steps of 5\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like most peoples ability to save low and medium danger goals are probably pretty high as it, is so quantifying their overall ability with GSAA is more helpful. Where the skill really comes in is in the high danger situations where the team is counting on the goalie alone to prevent the other team from scoring. Based on this graph I want to filter out individuals who fall below a 10 for GSAA to determine who the best goalie is.\n\n\nCode\nGoalie_final &lt;- Goalie_filtered %&gt;% \n  filter(GSAA &lt;= 10) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(HDGSAA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, HDGSAA)\n\nggplot(Goalie_final, aes(x = reorder(Player, -HDGSAA), y = HDGSAA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"High Danger GSAA for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"HDGSAA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results my nominations for this trophy would be:\n\nPyotr Kochetkov\nJoel Blomqvist\nJacob Markstrom\nLinus Ullmark\nJonas Johansson\n\n(way different than our results in class, but what do I know it makes sense to me)\n\n\nJames Norris Memorial Trophy\nWhat is it: Awarded to the defenseman who demonstrates “the greatest all-around ability” at the position.\nFirst I wanted to compare the percentages of SA and GA for each defensive player while they are on the ice. Similar to many of the other graphs, this could not be comparable because of the amount of time played or games play by each player. So first I looked at the amount of time each player spent on the ice per game.\n\n\nCode\ntop.defense &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;% \n  filter(Position == \"D\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) %&gt;%  \n  arrange(desc(TOI_by_GP)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, TOI_by_GP)\n\nggplot(top.defense, aes(x = reorder(Player, -TOI_by_GP), y = TOI_by_GP)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Time Played per Game for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"TOI/GP\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the new filtered dataset, I looked at the amount of goals against each persons team vs the amount of shots against the individuals teams. Players with lower scores mean that they’re defensive efforts are contributing significantly to the teams success. From this graph I decided to filter my final results to the individuals with less than 75 GA and 600 SA.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(top.defense, aes(x = SA, y = GA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Against vs Shots Against \",\n       x = \"Shots Against (SA)\",\n       y = \"Goals Against (GA)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, I decided to look at the count of scores against the team from my filtered dataset. These individuals have spent the most time on the ice during the games, had the least amount of goals against and shots against their team, as well as the lowest chance of scores against their team while they were on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nwin.defense &lt;- top.defense %&gt;% \n    filter(GA &lt;= 75 ) %&gt;% \n    filter(SA &lt;= 600 ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(SCA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, SCA)\n\nggplot(win.defense, aes(x = reorder(Player, SCA), y = SCA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Scoring Chances Against for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"SCA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of these results this would be my ballet:\n\nDrew Doughty\nTony DeAngelo\nFilip Hronek\nQuinn Hughes\nNoah Dobson\n\n\n\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nWhat is it: Given to the player “adjudged to be the most proficient in his first year of competition.” This is essentially the rookie of the year award.\nFor this trophy I filtered it similarly to Hart Memorial Trophy. I filtered the dataset to only include the top 50 players that had the most time played per game. I then compared this time to their overall Corsi percentage. I chose to filter the dataset again to only include the players that had spent more than 19 minutes on the ice per game because that time frame seemed to be when the Corsi statistics start to fall due to players spending more time on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nOnIce.rookie &lt;- OnIce.Skater.Rookie %&gt;%\n  mutate(TOI_per_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop.rookie &lt;- OnIce.rookie %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(TOI_per_GP)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(50, TOI_per_GP)\n\nggplot(top.rookie, aes(x = TOI_per_GP, y = CF.)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Corsi vs. Time played per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 30, by = 1)) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then created a bargraph to view the players with the highest Corsi percentage from this group.\n\n\nCode\ntop.rookie.cf &lt;- top.rookie %&gt;%\n  filter(TOI_per_GP &lt;= 19 ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top.rookie.cf, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results my ballot would be:\n\nAlex Laferriere\nBrandt Clarke\nPavel Dorofeyev\nJordan Spence\nMatt Coronato\n\n\n\nFrank J. Selke Trophy\nWhat is it: Awarded to the forward who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game.\nI started by filtering the On Ice dataset to just the forward positions and chose to analyze it similar to how I analyzed the defensive player data for the James Norris Memorial Trophy. I started by looking at the amount of time each player spent on the ice during each game and only kept the top 30.\n\n\nCode\ntop.ofd &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;% \n  filter(Position != \"D\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) %&gt;%  \n  arrange(desc(TOI_by_GP)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, TOI_by_GP)\n\nggplot(top.ofd, aes(x = reorder(Player, -TOI_by_GP), y = TOI_by_GP)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Time Played per Game Values for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"TOI/GP\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then looked at the number of goals and shots against each players teams while they were on the ice from the filtered data set. There are some players that have higher shots against their team, but less goals against their team. I want to select from the lowest values from both of these values so I filtered for the less the 60 shots against their team and less than 600 goals against their team.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(top.ofd, aes(x = SA, y = GA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Against vs Shots Against \",\n       x = \"Shots Against (SA)\",\n       y = \"Goals Against (GA)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly I wanted see the overall scores against the individuals teams from the filtered data set of the most time played per game with the least amount of shots and goals against their team.\n\n\nCode\nwin.ofd &lt;- top.ofd %&gt;% \n    filter(GA &lt;= 60 ) %&gt;% \n    filter(SA &lt;= 600 ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(SCA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, SCA)\n\nggplot(win.ofd, aes(x = reorder(Player, SCA), y = SCA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"SCA for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"SCA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Barzal\nKirill Kaprizov\nAleksander Barkov\nArtturi Lehkonen\nTim Stutzle\n\n\n\nLady Byng Memorial Trophy\nWhat is it: Presented to the player who exhibits “the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.”\nTo get at “sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct” I want to look at the number of penalties and misconducts by each player and only look at the playing abilities of those with lower counts. Since minor penalities are less aggressive I chose to focus on just the major penalties\n\n\nCode\nggplot(Indivdual.Skater, aes(x = Misconduct, y = Total.Penalties)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Sportmanship and Gentlemanly Conduct\",\n       x = \"# of Misconducts\",\n       y = \"Total Penalites\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are not many players with misconducts, so I am going to remove any players that have at least 1. Since we are aiming for players with the most gentlemanly like conduct I might as well filter out anyone with any penalties at all as well. I then took the top 30 players who have spent the most time on the ice per game. To compare their overall playing ability I am then going to look at their corsi percentage.\n\n\nCode\ngood.guys &lt;- Indivdual.Skater %&gt;% \n  filter(Misconduct &lt;= 0 ) %&gt;% \n  filter(Total.Penalties &lt;= 0 ) %&gt;% \n    mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) %&gt;%  \n      arrange(desc(TOI_by_GP)) %&gt;% \n      top_n(30, TOI_by_GP)\ngood.guys &lt;- good.guys %&gt;% \n  left_join(y = OnIce.Skater,\n            by = \"Player\")\n\nView(good.guys)\nggplot(good.guys, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy top picks for this trophy would be:\n\nAngus Crookshank\nTobias Bjornfot\nBrian Halonen\nCorey Schueneman\nDaniil Misyul"

    "text": "Located within the Columbia Plateau, the John Day Canyon is a steep, rugged landscape where sagebrush and grasses dominate the hillsides. This dynamic environment supports a unique population of bighorn sheep — one that, remarkably, has avoided the disease outbreaks that often devastate other herds.\nMy research focuses on understanding the nutritional requirements of these bighorn sheep and how those needs shift throughout their reproductive cycle due to changing metabolic demands. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that links their nutritional requirements to movement patterns. By doing so, we can identify potential threats, such as areas where bighorn sheep may come into contact with domestic livestock, and pinpoint critical habitats essential for their survival.\nTo achieve this, I am collecting vegetation data to calculate a measure of “suitable biomass”—essentially, the portion of available forage that meaningfully contributes to the sheep’s energy needs at different reproductive stages. This metric is created using measures of digestible energy and digestible protein. I have currently not finalized my values of “suitable biomass”, but I do have preliminary values of digestible energy and digestible protein from a subset of my data. Eventually using this metric, I will develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to map areas of high and low nutritional quality across the landscape.\nThese techniques will help determine which resources most influence bighorn sheep movement and allow us to predict future movement patterns—a critical step in ensuring their continued success in this landscape. By bridging nutritional ecology with movement ecology, this research will contribute valuable insights into how bighorn sheep navigate their environment and help inform conservation strategies for this unique, disease-free population.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(lpSolve)\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nlibrary(tools)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Define the path to the directory containing the file\nexcelpath &lt;- \"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/FRESH/processed.data/\"\n\n# Define the specific file name\nfilename &lt;- \"FRESH.Subset.xlsx\"\n\n# Construct the full file path\nexcel.file &lt;- file.path(excelpath, filename)\n\n# Load the workbook and read the data\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nhabitat &lt;- loadWorkbook(excel.file)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(readWorkbook(excel.file, sheet = \"FRESH Data\", startRow = 1, colNames = TRUE))\n\n\nplant &lt;-read.csv(\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/Cleaning/processed.data/plant.csv\")\n\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  rename(Code = Plant.Code) %&gt;% \n  left_join(y = plant, \n            by = \"Code\",\n            relationship = \"many-to-one\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further description as to what each of my variables are within my data set.

My main goal was to explore whether there is a correlation between high DE and high DP. The scatter plot results showed a pattern consistent with my expectations: the highest values for both DE and DP occur during the newly emergent (N) and budding (B) stages. These values drop sharply by the flowering (FL) stage and remain relatively stable thereafter.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndata$Phenology &lt;- factor(data$Phenology, levels = c(\"N\", \"B\", \"FL\", \"FR\", \"M\", \"C\"))\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = DP, y = DE)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"red\") + \n  labs(title = \"Relationship Between DE and DP by Phenology\",\n       x = \"Digestible Protein (DP)\",\n       y = \"Digestible Energy (DE)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Phenology, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.05, 0)) +  \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.05, 0)) +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better visualize the trends in DP and DE across phenological stages, I isolated the DE and DP values for direct comparison. Both metrics follow the expected pattern, showing a general decline over progressing phenological stage. While many species meet the DE requirement of 11.5 kJ per gram of forage, very few meet the necessary DP threshold of 7.5 g per 100 g of forage beyond the newly emergent stage. These thresholds represent the minimum forage quality needed to meet the energetic and protein demands of a lactating female sheep.\n\n\nCode\n# Ensure Phenology is a factor with the correct order\ndata$Phenology &lt;- factor(data$Phenology, levels = c(\"N\", \"B\", \"FL\", \"FR\", \"M\", \"C\"))\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = Phenology, y = DE, fill = Phenology)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +  \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Digestible Energy (DE) by Phenology\",\n       x = \"Phenology\",\n       y = \"DE(kJ g^-1)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 11.5, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6.4, y = 11.8, label = \"11.5\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"italic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data, aes(x = Phenology, y = DP, fill = Phenology)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +  \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Digestible Protien (DP) by Phenology\",\n       x = \"Phenology\",\n       y = \"DP (g protien/100g forage)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 7.5, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6.5, y = 8, label = \"7.5\", color = \"black\", size = 4, fontface = \"italic\")+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was curious whether this trend varied across different vegetation types, particularly in riparian areas, which retain the most moisture.

This analysis produced my estimate of “suitable biomass.”\nWhile my initial hypothesis was that riparian areas would stand out for their nutrient quality, this was not supported by the DE and DP values alone. However, due to the higher plant density in these moisture-rich areas, riparian zones did yield a much greater total biomass, resulting in higher suitable biomass values overall compared to other vegetation types.\nOne vegetation community that caught my attention was the scabland community. Found mostly on exposed ridges, these areas are typically rocky, wind-swept, and sun-exposed—conditions not usually associated with high productivity. However, these ridges are often the most accessible points in the landscape and are frequently used by landowners for grazing cattle on BLM land. They also lie closer to potential sources of agricultural runoff and experience more frequent disturbance. I suspect that these human influences may be altering the natural composition and productivity of the scabland community. Therefore, I plan to include distance to private land as a variable in my GAM, as I believe it may be a key factor shaping this vegetation type.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = PVT, y = SuitableBiomass, fill = PVT)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Suitable Biomass Across PVTs\",\n       x = \"Plant Vegetation Type (PVT)\",\n       y = \"Suitable Biomass\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 170))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I looked at how these forage quality metrics changed over time. It’s important to note that if a transect did not meet the nutritional requirements for a lactating female sheep, it was assigned a suitable biomass value of zero. Because of this, it may appear that my sampling ended in early July, even though I continued collecting data through August. This is likely because many transects no longer met the nutritional thresholds by mid-summer, resulting in more zeros for suitable biomass.\nThe trends in suitable biomass and digestible energy align with my expectations—they both decline over time. Digestible protein, however, remains relatively stable throughout the season.\nIt’s also reassuring to see that my assumption about the timing of the “green-up”—the period when forage is at its most nutritious—was accurate. The first graph shows a steady decline in suitable biomass until mid-May, after which values remain fairly constant with only a slight decrease through the rest of the summer.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the Julian days and corresponding month labels\ndate_breaks &lt;- c(92, 122, 155, 185)\ndate_labels &lt;- c(\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\")\n\n\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = SuitableBiomass)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Suitable Biomass Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"Suitable Biomass\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = AveDE)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average DE Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"DE\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = AveDP)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average DP Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"DP\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key parts of my project is understanding the spread of invasive species throughout the canyon, specifically cheat grass. When observing the canyon it seems like cheat grass dominates the landscape which could effect the amount of nutrients available later in the summer after much of it has progressed through its flowering stage. To start I wanted to looks at the density of biomass for all native versus invasive species within the transects that I sampled in our study area. From this graph we can see that overall biomass of native and invasive species is relatively similar throughout the canyon. However, there is an overall greater density of native species.\n\n\nCode\nspp.map &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  select(TransectID, Code, Phenology, Part, Biomass, Duration, Status)\n\nplot &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/Cleaning/processed.data/transect.csv\")\n\nspp.map &lt;- spp.map %&gt;% \n  rename(PlotID = TransectID)\n\nspp.map &lt;- spp.map %&gt;% \n  left_join(y = plot,\n            by = \"PlotID\",\n            relationship = \"many-to-one\")\n\nspp.map &lt;- spp.map %&gt;% \n  rename(Lat = BeginLat,\n         Long = BeginLong,\n         Easting = BeginUTM_Easting,\n         Northing = BeginUTM_Northing) %&gt;% \n  select(PlotID, Code, Phenology, Part, Biomass, Duration, Status, Julian_Day, Lat, Long, Easting, Northing)\n\n\n# Create an sf object with the Lat and Long columns\nspp.map_UTM &lt;- st_as_sf(spp.map, coords = c(\"Long\", \"Lat\"), crs = 4326)  # EPSG:4326 is WGS84\n\n# Convert to UTM Zone 11N (EPSG:26911)\nspp.map_UTM &lt;- st_transform(spp.map_UTM, crs = 32611)\n\n# Extract UTM coordinates (Easting and Northing)\nspp.map$Easting &lt;- st_coordinates(spp.map_UTM)[, 1]\nspp.map$Northing &lt;- st_coordinates(spp.map_UTM)[, 2]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Summarize biomass weight by spatial location and species status\nspp.summary &lt;- spp.map %&gt;%\n   filter(!is.na(Biomass) & Biomass &gt; 0)  # Remove NAs\n  \nggplot(spp.summary, aes(x = Easting, y = Northing, weight = Biomass)) +\n  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = after_stat(density)), geom = \"raster\", contour = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Status) +  # Separate maps for Native/Invasive\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Biomass Density\", \n    option = \"turbo\",\n    breaks = c(1e-09, 7e-09),  # Define specific density values\n    labels = c(\"Low\", \"High\")  # Replace numerical values with \"Low\" and \"High\"\n  ) +  \n  labs(title = \"Density of Biomass (Native vs Invasive Species)\",\n       x = \"Easting\", \n       y = \"Northing\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),  # Remove tick labels\n    axis.ticks = element_blank())  # Rotate x-axis labels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am still currently using only a subset of my quality data, so these results may be slightly skewed from the results of my complete data set.\nI would also like to see the differences in overall biomass for each month.

That said, the data I do have suggest that cheatgrass biomass peaked in the southern end of the canyon around June and began to decline after that.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for observations with Species Code \"BRTE\"\ncheat.sum &lt;- spp.map %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Biomass) & Biomass &gt; 0, Code == \"BRTE\") %&gt;%  # Remove NAs and filter for \"BRTE\"\n  mutate(Month = case_when(\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 93 & Julian_Day &lt; 124 ~ \"April\",\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 124 & Julian_Day &lt; 155 ~ \"May\",\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 155 & Julian_Day &lt; 185 ~ \"June\",\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 185 & Julian_Day &lt;= 212 ~ \"July\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_\n  )) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Month)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = c(\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\")))  # Set correct order\n\n# Normalize biomass within each month (to make sample sizes comparable)\ncheat.sum &lt;- cheat.sum %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total_Biomass = sum(Biomass),  # Calculate total biomass for each month\n         Normalized_Biomass = Biomass / Total_Biomass) %&gt;%  # Normalize biomass\n  ungroup()  # Remove grouping\n\n# Create density plot faceted by Month and Status for species \"BRTE\"\nggplot(cheat.sum, aes(x = Easting, y = Northing, weight = Normalized_Biomass)) +\n  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = after_stat(density)), geom = \"raster\", contour = FALSE) +\n  facet_grid(Month ~ Code) +  # Grid facet by Month (rows) and Status (columns)\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Biomass Density\", \n    option = \"turbo\",\n    breaks = c(2e-09, 14e-09),  # Define specific density values\n    labels = c(\"Low \", \"High \")  # Replace numerical values with \"Low\" and \"High\"\n  ) +  \n  labs(title = \"Normalized Density of Biomass for BRTE by month\",\n       x = \"Easting\", \n       y = \"Northing\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),  # Remove tick labels\n        axis.ticks = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metric of “suitable biomass” is a single value applied to my transect, so I have not figured out how to apply that value to specific species.

(another graph to add to the to-do list)\n\n\n\nLastly, I want to see how the sheep movements change each month with the overall biomass of both native and invasive species. I started out by creating a heat map of our overall sheep location use throughout the canyon.\n\n\nCode\ngps &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Demographics/Code/cleaned.data/sheep_clean_24.csv\")\n\ngps &lt;- gps %&gt;% \n  rename(Easting = x_,\n         Northing = y_)\n\n# Step 1: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for GPS data\ngps_kde &lt;- ggplot(gps, aes(x = Easting, y = Northing)) +\n  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = after_stat(density)), geom = \"raster\", contour = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"inferno\",\n          name = \"GPS Use Density\",\n          breaks = c(2e-09, 10e-09),  # Define specific density values\n          labels = c(\"Low\", \"High\")  # Replace  values with \"Low\" and \"High\"\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Sheep Area Use\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),  # Remove tick labels\n        axis.ticks = element_blank()) \n  plot(gps_kde)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the areas of high biomass density align with values of high nutrient quality in theory this means that the density of our sheep points should also follow the trends of high biomass density in the months of April and May. I wanted to see if I could overlay our sheep locations each month with the biomass density data each month to observe my hunch that sheep would follow this trend in these months. They do not appear to follow this trend, most likely due to other outside factors such as selection for escape terrain that outweigh the need to follow vegetation trends. It is also likely that areas of high biomass does not always mean areas of high nutritional quality.\n\n\nCode\nmonth.sum &lt;- spp.map %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Biomass) & Biomass &gt; 0) %&gt;%  # Remove NAs\n  mutate(Month = case_when(\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 93 & Julian_Day &lt; 124 ~ \"April\",\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 124 & Julian_Day &lt; 155 ~ \"May\",\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 155 & Julian_Day &lt; 185 ~ \"June\",\n    Julian_Day &gt;= 185 & Julian_Day &lt;= 212 ~ \"July\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_\n  )) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Month)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = c(\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\")))\n\n\n# Normalize biomass within each month (to make sample sizes comparable)\nmonth.sum &lt;- month.sum %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total_Biomass = sum(Biomass),  # Calculate total biomass for each month\n         Normalized_Biomass = Biomass / Total_Biomass) %&gt;%  # Normalize biomass\n  ungroup()  # Remove grouping\n\n# Extract month from the GPS timestamp\ngps &lt;- gps %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = case_when(\n    month(t_) == 4 ~ \"April\",\n    month(t_) == 5 ~ \"May\",\n    month(t_) == 6 ~ \"June\",\n    month(t_) == 7 ~ \"July\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_\n  )) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Month)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = c(\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\")))\n\nggplot() + # Biomass density heatmap using kernel density estimation\n  stat_density_2d(\n    data = month.sum,\n    aes(x = Easting, y = Northing, weight = Normalized_Biomass, fill = after_stat(density)),\n    geom = \"raster\",\n    contour = FALSE\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(Month ~ Status) +  # Grid facet by Month (rows) and Status (columns)\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(\n    name = \"Biomass Density\", \n    option = \"turbo\",\n    breaks = c(2e-09, 18e-09),  # Define specific density values\n    labels = c(\"Low\", \"High\")  # Replace numerical values with \"Low\" and \"High\"\n  ) +  \n  labs(title = \"Normalized Density of Biomass with GPS Locations (Native vs Invasive Species by Month)\",\n       x = \"Easting\", \n       y = \"Northing\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),  # Remove tick labels\n        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +\n  # Overlay GPS points, filtering by Month to match the facet\n  geom_point(\n    data = gps, \n    aes(x = Easting, y = Northing), \n    color = \"red\", alpha = 0.1, size = 0.4\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Define the path to the directory containing the file\nexcelpath &lt;- \"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/FRESH/processed.data/\"\n\n# Define the specific file name\nfilename &lt;- \"2024.subset.results.xlsx\"\n\n# Construct the full file path\nexcel.file &lt;- file.path(excelpath, filename)\n\n# Load the workbook and read the data\n\nhabitat &lt;- loadWorkbook(excel.file)\nsuitable &lt;- data.frame(readWorkbook(excel.file, sheet = \"Plot-Level-Summary\", startRow = 1, colNames = TRUE))\n\n\nsuitable.map &lt;- suitable %&gt;% \n  rename(PlotID = TransectID) %&gt;% \n  left_join(y = plot,\n            by = \"PlotID\")\n\nsuitable.map &lt;- suitable.map %&gt;% \n  rename(Lat = BeginLat,\n         Long = BeginLong,\n         Easting = BeginUTM_Easting,\n         Northing = BeginUTM_Northing) %&gt;% \n  select(PlotID, TotalDE, TotalDP, SuitableBiomass, AveDE, AveDP, Julian_Day, Lat, Long, Easting, Northing)\nView(suitable.map)\n\n# Create an sf object with the Lat and Long columns\nsuitable.map_UTM &lt;- st_as_sf(suitable.map, coords = c(\"Long\", \"Lat\"), crs = 4326)  # EPSG:4326 is WGS84\n\n# Convert to UTM Zone 11N (EPSG:26911)\nsuitable.map_UTM &lt;- st_transform(suitable.map_UTM, crs = 32611)\n\n# Extract UTM coordinates (Easting and Northing)\nsuitable.map$Easting &lt;- st_coordinates(suitable.map_UTM)[, 1]\nsuitable.map$Northing &lt;- st_coordinates(suitable.map_UTM)[, 2]\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing the FRESH model using a subset of my data, I was able to get estimates of suitable biomass available at each transect that I sampled.

While this is most likely the month with the largest amount of species in their nutrient dense phase, it is also the month that we sampled the most. So I feel like the sampling efforts may be slightly skewing my data.\nIn order to truly see these values accurately represented across my study area, I will need to start creating my predictive GAM. This will allow me to project these values of suitable biomass to other 30x30m pixels with similar covariates and predict how vegetative quality changes throughout the canyon in different times of the year."

    "text": "Located within the Columbia Plateau, the John Day Canyon is a steep, rugged landscape where sagebrush and grasses dominate the hillsides. This dynamic environment supports a unique population of bighorn sheep — one that, remarkably, has avoided the disease outbreaks that often devastate other herds.\nMy research focuses on understanding the nutritional requirements of these bighorn sheep and how those needs shift throughout their reproductive cycle due to changing metabolic demands. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that links their nutritional requirements to movement patterns. By doing so, we can identify potential threats, such as areas where bighorn sheep may come into contact with domestic livestock, and pinpoint critical habitats essential for their survival.\nTo achieve this, I am collecting vegetation data to calculate a measure of “suitable biomass”—essentially, the portion of available forage that meaningfully contributes to the sheep’s energy needs at different reproductive stages. This metric is created using measures of digestible energy and digestible protein. I have currently not finalized my values of “suitable biomass”, but I do have preliminary values of digestible energy and digestible protein from a subset of my data. Eventually using this metric, I will develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to map areas of high and low nutritional quality across the landscape.\nThese techniques will help determine which resources most influence bighorn sheep movement and allow us to predict future movement patterns—a critical step in ensuring their continued success in this landscape. By bridging nutritional ecology with movement ecology, this research will contribute valuable insights into how bighorn sheep navigate their environment and help inform conservation strategies for this unique, disease-free population.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(lpSolve)\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nlibrary(tools)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Define the path to the directory containing the file\nexcelpath &lt;- \"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/FRESH/processed.data/\"\n\n# Define the specific file name\nfilename &lt;- \"FRESH.Subset.xlsx\"\n\n# Construct the full file path\nexcel.file &lt;- file.path(excelpath, filename)\n\n# Load the workbook and read the data\nlibrary(openxlsx)\nhabitat &lt;- loadWorkbook(excel.file)\ndata &lt;- data.frame(readWorkbook(excel.file, sheet = \"FRESH Data\", startRow = 1, colNames = TRUE))\n\n\nplant &lt;-read.csv(\"C:/Users/Alexis Means/Documents/Project/Nutrition Sampling/R code/Cleaning/processed.data/plant.csv\")\n\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  rename(Code = Plant.Code) %&gt;% \n  left_join(y = plant, \n            by = \"Code\",\n            relationship = \"many-to-one\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further description as to what each of my variables are within my data set.

    "text": "One of the key parts of my project is understanding the spread of invasive species throughout the canyon, specifically cheat grass. When observing the canyon it seems like cheat grass dominates the landscape which could effect the amount of nutrients available later in the summer after much of it has progressed through its flowering stage. To start I wanted to looks at the density of biomass for all native versus invasive species within the transects that I sampled in our study area.

This analysis produced my estimate of “suitable biomass.”\nWhile my initial hypothesis was that riparian areas would stand out for their nutrient quality, this was not supported by the DE and DP values alone. However, due to the higher plant density in these moisture-rich areas, riparian zones did yield a much greater total biomass, resulting in higher suitable biomass values overall compared to other vegetation types.\nOne vegetation community that caught my attention was the scabland community. Found mostly on exposed ridges, these areas are typically rocky, wind-swept, and sun-exposed—conditions not usually associated with high productivity. However, these ridges are often the most accessible points in the landscape and are frequently used by landowners for grazing cattle on BLM land. They also lie closer to potential sources of agricultural runoff and experience more frequent disturbance. I suspect that these human influences may be altering the natural composition and productivity of the scabland community. Therefore, I plan to include distance to private land as a variable in my GAM, as I believe it may be a key factor shaping this vegetation type.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = PVT, y = SuitableBiomass, fill = PVT)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7, outlier.shape = NA) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Suitable Biomass Across PVTs\",\n       x = \"Plant Vegetation Type (PVT)\",\n       y = \"Suitable Biomass\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 170))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I looked at how these forage quality metrics changed over time. It’s important to note that if a transect did not meet the nutritional requirements for a lactating female sheep, it was assigned a suitable biomass value of zero. Because of this, it may appear that my sampling ended in early July, even though I continued collecting data through August. This is likely because many transects no longer met the nutritional thresholds by mid-summer, resulting in more zeros for suitable biomass.\nThe trends in suitable biomass and digestible energy align with my expectations—they both decline over time. Digestible protein, however, remains relatively stable throughout the season.\nIt’s also reassuring to see that my assumption about the timing of the “green-up”—the period when forage is at its most nutritious—was accurate. The first graph shows a steady decline in suitable biomass until mid-May, after which values remain fairly constant with only a slight decrease through the rest of the summer.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the Julian days and corresponding month labels\ndate_breaks &lt;- c(92, 122, 155, 185)\ndate_labels &lt;- c(\"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\")\n\n\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = SuitableBiomass)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Suitable Biomass Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"Suitable Biomass\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = AveDE)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average DE Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"DE\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(suitable, aes(x = Julian_Day, y = AveDP)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = PVT), alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = TRUE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Average DP Over Time\",\n       x = \"Julian Day\",\n       y = \"DP\",\n       color = \"PVT\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = date_breaks,\n    labels = date_labels,\n    limits = c(min(date_breaks), max(date_breaks))\n  )"

Most of the species that were observed with the highest DE were in the newly emergent (N) or budding (B) stages which is as to be expected. There was only two flowering species that fell within the top 20 with the highest DE which were (ERCO12) at 13.47 and (LONU2) at 13.26, one fruiting species (TRDU) at 13.26 and two mature species (CREPIS) at 13.56 and (TACA8) at 13.2. I was surprised to see any mature species make it within the top 20 highest digestible energy values.
