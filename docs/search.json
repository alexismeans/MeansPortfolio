    "text": "My name is Alexis Means! I’m a research assistant working with the University of Idaho and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to study one of Oregon’s most successful bighorn sheep populations. My research focuses on how these sheep navigate their environment and make tough decisions about what to eat when faced with difficult tradeoffs.\nEarly on, I’ll be analyzing vegetation data to see how different plant species and growth stages change across multiple vegetation communities and seasons. In the long run, I’ll use this information to build a model that maps the nutritional landscape, helping us better understand bighorn sheep movement."

    "text": "Describing my Data\nThese datasets come together to create a multidimensional table with all kinds of information about the species observed in my transects. Each table focuses on a unique combination of species ID and phenology stage, which is what I’m using as the main unit of observation. To describe each of these unique combinations, I’ve included several attributes. The quantitative ones include things like biomass weight, percent aerial cover, and nutritional quality. There are also some categorical attributes, like the vegetation community where the species was found and the season it was observed.

I’ve also included a table that lists and explains all the attributes—some are repeated across datasets, so I’ve only described them once.

Because some of the names are so obnoxiously long, I decided it was more effective to color each box and use a key to identify the different communities. I was surprised to see that the scabland shrubland community had the greatest biodiversity. A lot of our sampling was done within the grassland community because it makes up a majority of our study area, so I expected that or the riparian area to have the greatest diversity. The more you know I guess.\n\n\nPVT Species Composition\nIf I wanted to approach this slightly different and make it really overwhelming, I could look at the composition of species observed in each community instead of the richness and show each species in a stacked bar graph.\n\n\nCode\ncomp1 &lt;- comp1 %&gt;% mutate(PVT = as.factor(PVT))\n\ntop_30 &lt;- comp1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(PVT, ActualName.x) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  arrange(PVT, desc(Count)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PVT) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 30)\n\ntop_10_names &lt;- top_30 %&gt;%\n  count(ActualName.x, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10) %&gt;%\n  pull(ActualName.x)\n\nggplot(top_30 %&gt;% filter(ActualName.x %in% top_10_names), \n       aes(x = PVT, y = Count, fill = ActualName.x)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Species composition within Vegetation Communities\",\n       x = \"Vegetation Type\", y = \"Spp Count\", fill = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\", \n        legend.key.size = unit(5, \"pt\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is a mess of squished colors and scientific names that most people don’t know or care about when making this comparison. It also does not get the same point across that I do when comparing species richness. Since I sampled the grassland community so much, comparing its diversity to the other vegetation communities is inconsistent and does not demonstrate the diversity of that community. Believe it or not I also had to limit the number of names to the top 30 within the legend to make the graph even remotely readable."

There is so much information and overlap between the different lines that it is hard to tell what is happening with any of them because they are stacked on top of each other. The color scale also does not work for this because of the gradient, the colors are too closely related and are even harder to differentiate when they are all jumbled together."

I could limit this to my top 10 species (because who really cares about the tiny insignificant ones anyway) and it would make it easier to read.\n\n\nCode\nbiomass1 &lt;- comp1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(ActualName.x) %&gt;%\n  mutate(totalbiomass = mean(DryWeight.g., na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  filter(totalbiomass &gt; 10)\n\nggplot(biomass1, aes(x = Spp, y = totalbiomass, color = ActualName.x == \"BROMUS TECTORUM\")) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8, position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0)) +  \n  labs(\n   title = \"Total Biomass by Species\",\n    x = \"Species \",\n    y = \"Total Biomass\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", \"red\"), guide = \"none\") +  \n  xlab(NULL) +\n theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore this\n\n\nCode\n#totalbiomass &lt;- comp1 %&gt;% \n#  left_join(y=transect,\n#            by = \"PlotID\") %&gt;% \n#    mutate(Season = case_when(\n#    Julian_Day.x &gt;= 75 & Julian_Day.x &lt;= 153 ~ \"SP\",\n#    Julian_Day.x &gt;= 154 & Julian_Day.x &lt;= 228 ~ \"SU\",\n#    TRUE ~ NA_character_  # Assign NA for values outside these ranges\n# )) %&gt;% \n# group_by(Season, PVT.x) %&gt;% \n#  mutate(bio = mean(DryWeight.g.))\n         \n#  totalbiomass$PVT.x &lt;- factor(totalbiomass$PVT.x)\n#View(totalbiomass)\n\n#ggplot(totalbiomass, aes(x = Season, y = bio, fill = PVT.x)) +\n# geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",position = \"dodge\") +   \n#  labs(\n#    title = \"Biomass by PVT\",\n#    x = \"PVT\",\n#   y = \"Total Biomass (g)\"\n#  ) +\n#  theme_minimal()+\n#  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n#ggplot(totalbiomass, aes(x = Season, y = bio, fill = Season)) +\n#  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +  \n#  facet_wrap(~ PVT.x, scales = \"free_x\", strip.position = \"bottom\") +  # Creates separate panels for each PVT\n#  labs(\n#    title = \"Biomass by PVT and Season\",\n#    x = \"PVT\",\n#    y = \"Total Biomass (g)\"\n#  ) +\n#  theme_minimal()\n#View(comp2)"

I started by looking at the Corsi % for each of the players.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ntop_players &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top_players, aes(x = reorder(Player,-CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it arguable that individuals with less time on the ice or do not play as many games are not contributing as much to their teams success. I decided to show a scatterplot of the Corsi percentage compared to the players time spent on the ice during the game. This showed that some of the individuals with the highest Corsi score did not spend as much time on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nOnIce.Skater &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;%\n  mutate(TOI_per_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop_players &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(20, CF.)\n  \nggplot(top_players, aes(x = TOI_per_GP, y = CF.)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) vs. Time played per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 2)) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this I chose to filter the dataset one more time to only include individuals who spent more than 16 minutes on the ice per game and then created a bar graph to view individuals with the highest corsi percentage within this group.\n\n\nCode\ntop.indv &lt;- top_players %&gt;%\n  filter(TOI_per_GP &lt;= 16 ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top.indv, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing these results my top 5 picks would be:\n\nNathan Clurman\nSamuel Bolduc\nJustin Sourdif\nEmil Bemstrom\nRasmus Asplund\n\n\n\nVezina Trophy\nWhat is it: Presented to the goaltender “adjudged to be the best at this position.” NHL general managers vote on this award.\nI wanted to start of by looking at the statistics fo the GSAA (goals saved above average). To me this seemed like the most valuable statistic to determine which goaltender is the best at what they do. I compared the GSAA to each players time spent on the ice per games played again.\n\n\nCode\nGoalie &lt;- Goalie %&gt;% \n   mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop_goalie &lt;- Goalie %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(GSAA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, GSAA)\n\nggplot(top_goalie, aes(x = TOI_by_GP, y = GSAA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Saved Above Average vs. Time player per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"GSAA\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(40, 65, by = 5)) +  # Custom x-axis intervals from 15 to 30 in steps of 5\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince most of the players averaged above 50 TOI/GP, I decided to remove anyone who spent less than 50 TOI/GP because they will most likely have skewed numbers. I then decided to compare the GSAA to the high danger GSAA.\n\n\nCode\nGoalie_filtered&lt;- Goalie %&gt;%\n  filter(TOI_by_GP &gt;= 50)\n\ntop_goalie &lt;- Goalie_filtered %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(GSAA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, GSAA)\n\nggplot(top_goalie, aes(x = HDGSAA, y = GSAA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Saved Above Average vs. High Danger Goals Saved Above Average \",\n       x = \"HDGSAA\",\n       y = \"GSAA\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 65, by = 10)) +  # Custom x-axis intervals from 15 to 30 in steps of 5\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like most peoples ability to save low and medium danger goals are probably pretty high as it, is so quantifying their overall ability with GSAA is more helpful. Where the skill really comes in is in the high danger situations where the team is counting on the goalie alone to prevent the other team from scoring. Based on this graph I want to filter out individuals who fall below a 10 for GSAA to determine who the best goalie is.\n\n\nCode\nGoalie_final &lt;- Goalie_filtered %&gt;% \n  filter(GSAA &lt;= 10) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(HDGSAA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, HDGSAA)\n\nggplot(Goalie_final, aes(x = reorder(Player, -HDGSAA), y = HDGSAA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"High Danger GSAA for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"HDGSAA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results my nominations for this trophy would be:\n\nPyotr Kochetkov\nJoel Blomqvist\nJacob Markstrom\nLinus Ullmark\nJonas Johansson\n\n(way different than our results in class, but what do I know it makes sense to me)\n\n\nJames Norris Memorial Trophy\nWhat is it: Awarded to the defenseman who demonstrates “the greatest all-around ability” at the position.\nFirst I wanted to compare the percentages of SA and GA for each defensive player while they are on the ice. Similar to many of the other graphs, this could not be comparable because of the amount of time played or games play by each player. So first I looked at the amount of time each player spent on the ice per game.\n\n\nCode\ntop.defense &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;% \n  filter(Position == \"D\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) %&gt;%  \n  arrange(desc(TOI_by_GP)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, TOI_by_GP)\n\nggplot(top.defense, aes(x = reorder(Player, -TOI_by_GP), y = TOI_by_GP)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Time Played per Game for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"TOI/GP\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the new filtered dataset, I looked at the amount of goals against each persons team vs the amount of shots against the individuals teams. Players with lower scores mean that they’re defensive efforts are contributing significantly to the teams success. From this graph I decided to filter my final results to the individuals with less than 75 GA and 600 SA.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(top.defense, aes(x = SA, y = GA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Against vs Shots Against \",\n       x = \"Shots Against (SA)\",\n       y = \"Goals Against (GA)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, I decided to look at the count of scores against the team from my filtered dataset. These individuals have spent the most time on the ice during the games, had the least amount of goals against and shots against their team, as well as the lowest chance of scores against their team while they were on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nwin.defense &lt;- top.defense %&gt;% \n    filter(GA &lt;= 75 ) %&gt;% \n    filter(SA &lt;= 600 ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(SCA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, SCA)\n\nggplot(win.defense, aes(x = reorder(Player, SCA), y = SCA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Scoring Chances Against for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"SCA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of these results this would be my ballet:\n\nDrew Doughty\nTony DeAngelo\nFilip Hronek\nQuinn Hughes\nNoah Dobson\n\n\n\nCalder Memorial Trophy\nWhat is it: Given to the player “adjudged to be the most proficient in his first year of competition.” This is essentially the rookie of the year award.\nFor this trophy I filtered it similarly to Hart Memorial Trophy. I filtered the dataset to only include the top 50 players that had the most time played per game. I then compared this time to their overall Corsi percentage. I chose to filter the dataset again to only include the players that had spent more than 19 minutes on the ice per game because that time frame seemed to be when the Corsi statistics start to fall due to players spending more time on the ice.\n\n\nCode\nOnIce.rookie &lt;- OnIce.Skater.Rookie %&gt;%\n  mutate(TOI_per_GP = TOI / GP) \n\ntop.rookie &lt;- OnIce.rookie %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(TOI_per_GP)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(50, TOI_per_GP)\n\nggplot(top.rookie, aes(x = TOI_per_GP, y = CF.)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Corsi vs. Time played per Game\",\n       x = \"Time played per Game\",\n       y = \"Corsi (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 30, by = 1)) +  \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then created a bargraph to view the players with the highest Corsi percentage from this group.\n\n\nCode\ntop.rookie.cf &lt;- top.rookie %&gt;%\n  filter(TOI_per_GP &lt;= 19 ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(CF.)) %&gt;%\n  top_n(30, CF.)\n\nggplot(top.rookie.cf, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results my ballot would be:\n\nAlex Laferriere\nBrandt Clarke\nPavel Dorofeyev\nJordan Spence\nMatt Coronato\n\n\n\nFrank J. Selke Trophy\nWhat is it: Awarded to the forward who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game.\nI started by filtering the On Ice dataset to just the forward positions and chose to analyze it similar to how I analyzed the defensive player data for the James Norris Memorial Trophy. I started by looking at the amount of time each player spent on the ice during each game and only kept the top 30.\n\n\nCode\ntop.ofd &lt;- OnIce.Skater %&gt;% \n  filter(Position != \"D\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) %&gt;%  \n  arrange(desc(TOI_by_GP)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, TOI_by_GP)\n\nggplot(top.ofd, aes(x = reorder(Player, -TOI_by_GP), y = TOI_by_GP)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Time Played per Game Values for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"TOI/GP\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then looked at the number of goals and shots against each players teams while they were on the ice from the filtered data set. There are some players that have higher shots against their team, but less goals against their team. I want to select from the lowest values from both of these values so I filtered for the less the 60 shots against their team and less than 600 goals against their team.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(top.ofd, aes(x = SA, y = GA)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Goals Against vs Shots Against \",\n       x = \"Shots Against (SA)\",\n       y = \"Goals Against (GA)\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly I wanted see the overall scores against the individuals teams from the filtered data set of the most time played per game with the least amount of shots and goals against their team.\n\n\nCode\nwin.ofd &lt;- top.ofd %&gt;% \n    filter(GA &lt;= 60 ) %&gt;% \n    filter(SA &lt;= 600 ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(SCA)) %&gt;% \n  top_n(30, SCA)\n\nggplot(win.ofd, aes(x = reorder(Player, SCA), y = SCA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"SCA for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"SCA\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Barzal\nKirill Kaprizov\nAleksander Barkov\nArtturi Lehkonen\nTim Stutzle\n\n\n\nLady Byng Memorial Trophy\nWhat is it: Presented to the player who exhibits “the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.”\nTo get at “sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct” I want to look at the number of penalties and misconducts by each player and only look at the playing abilities of those with lower counts. Since minor penalities are less aggressive I chose to focus on just the major penalties\n\n\nCode\nggplot(Indivdual.Skater, aes(x = Misconduct, y = Total.Penalties)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Player), alpha = 0.6) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Sportmanship and Gentlemanly Conduct\",\n       x = \"# of Misconducts\",\n       y = \"Total Penalites\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are not many players with misconducts, so I am going to remove any players that have at least 1. Since we are aiming for players with the most gentlemanly like conduct I might as well filter out anyone with any penalties at all as well. I then took the top 30 players who have spent the most time on the ice per game. To compare their overall playing ability I am then going to look at their corsi percentage.\n\n\nCode\ngood.guys &lt;- Indivdual.Skater %&gt;% \n  filter(Misconduct &lt;= 0 ) %&gt;% \n  filter(Total.Penalties &lt;= 0 ) %&gt;% \n    mutate(TOI_by_GP = TOI / GP) %&gt;%  \n      arrange(desc(TOI_by_GP)) %&gt;% \n      top_n(30, TOI_by_GP)\ngood.guys &lt;- good.guys %&gt;% \n  left_join(y = OnIce.Skater,\n            by = \"Player\")\n\nView(good.guys)\nggplot(good.guys, aes(x = reorder(Player, -CF.), y = CF.)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +   \n  theme_minimal() +              \n  labs(title = \"Corsi(%) for Each Player\", x = \"Player\", y = \"Corsi(%)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy top picks for this trophy would be:\n\nAngus Crookshank\nTobias Bjornfot\nBrian Halonen\nCorey Schueneman\nDaniil Misyul"
