Each table focuses on a unique combination of species ID and phenology stage, which is what I’m using as the main unit of observation. To describe each of these unique combinations, I’ve included several attributes. The quantitative ones include things like biomass weight, percent aerial cover, and nutritional quality. There are also some categorical attributes, like the vegetation community where the species was found and the season it was observed. For now, I’m working with this data as a table to calculate summary statistics, but eventually, I’ll convert it into spatial data. I’ve also included a table that lists and explains all the attributes—some are repeated across datasets, so I’ve only described them once.
